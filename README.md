We know that when you are out to dinner or at the market - you want to be a savvy and confident wine connoisseur.  To do that - you need objective and high quality tools to help you choose the perfect wine.

The problem is there's too much noise and confusion in selecting the perfect bottle, making you feel anxious and apprehensive in your selections.  We believe having peace of mind while buying your wines shouldn't be so hard.

Imagine if you could pick the perfect bottle using machine learning.  

Watch how we break down features from over 6000 Portugese red and white wines and predict to 90% accuracy low vs high quality wines.  

Stop worrying about about paying for low quality wines - instead let Classification models narrow down your selection. 

"I'll take some cheese with my wine..."

In this project, we utilized several classification models to predict a "high quality" wine from the rest. We utilized linear & logrithmic regression, random forest classifier, balanced random forest classifier, and the easy ensemble methods to achieve a 90% accuracy via the random forest classifier after hyperparameter tuning. Though slightly less than the 95% accuracy in the kaggle project due to a lack of outlier elimination, we believe the entire data set utilization was more appropriate, and we are very satisfied with the 90% confidence achieved.

Salute!
