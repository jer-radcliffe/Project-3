"I'll take some cheese with my wine..."

In this project, we utilized several classification models to predict a "high quality" wine from the rest. We utilized linear & logrithmic regression, random forest classifier, balanced random forest classifier, and the easy ensemble methods to achieve a 90% accuracy via the random forest classifier after hyperparameter tuning. Though slightly less than the 95% accuracy in the kaggle project due to a lack of outlier elimination, we believe the entire data set utilization was more appropriate, and we are very satisfied with the 90% confidence achieved.

Salute!
